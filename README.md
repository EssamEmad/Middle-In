# Middle-In

## Description:
Middle-in is a less cool version of Middle-out that uses huffman codes to compress text and binary files.

## Algorithm Description:

Middle-In generates huffman codes for each character in the text file, prints out the codes in the header, then prints out the encoded text file in the compressed zip file.
